#What are the pros and cons of TDD?

On the positive side, TDD can significantly enhance code quality. When developers write code guided by pre-existing tests, they gain a clear understanding of the expected input-output relationships and follow better coding practices, resulting in fewer bugs. Debugging becomes more straightforward, as developers can run tests to compare expected and actual outcomes. Over the long term, TDD breaks the project into manageable components, making the codebase more maintainable.

However, there are potential downsides to TDD. One is the added development effort required to write tests before coding. Overemphasizing this aspect can stall progress in the main project. Inexperienced developers might struggle due to the learning curve and may create incomplete test coverage, leaving project vulnerabilities. TDD can also complicate code changes, as developers must consider the existing tests and adapt them to accommodate new features, leading to additional work.
